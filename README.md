A small personal tool to help me write song lyrics, for Udio.com, and I thought someone else could maybe make use of it as well.
It's made purely with HTML/CSS/JS, so you should be able to just open the index.html in any browser.

##Key Features:##

**Writing Interface:**
1. Real-time word and letter counter (excluding words within [] and ()), helping you keep track of your lyric length.

**Word Highlighting:**
1. Highlights your lyrics in alternating colors based on word count chunks.
2. Adjusts according to selected song duration and tempo to help visualize pacing.

**Duration and Tempo Settings:**
1.The tool adjusts word chunk sizes based on these settings, giving you an idea of how your lyrics fit within the song structure.

**Text-to-speech:**
(Browser-based, options are dependent on the browser. I recommend using Edge, as it provides AI voices and supports many languages.)
1. Select a language, voice, and tempo.
2. Highlight text within the editor to read it. If nothing is selected, the full text will be read.

**Cheat-Sheet:**
1. A handy reference for common tags and annotations used in songwriting.
2. Type / to view a list of the official tags, much like on Udio.

**Rhyme Finder with Filtering:**
1. Enter a word to get a list of rhyming words based on matching ending letters.
2. Customize the rhyme search by selecting the number of ending letters to match.
3. Use a slider to filter rhymes by word length, helping you find words that fit your desired syllable count.

**Save and Load Functionality:**
1. Save your work as a .json file, including your title, prompt, lyrics, duration, tempo, and a timestamp.
2. Load previously saved songs to continue where you left off.

##Installation:##
Just download the folder and extract it to any location on your computer. No installation is required! Simply open the file named 'index.html' in your browser, and you're good to go. 
The code is designed to run directly in the browser without the need for a local environment.
